## Description
<!-- What was your motivation? -->

The motivation behind restructing this html file is so that the webpage meets accissibility standards as it reinforces the meanings of its contect.

<!-- Why did you build this project? -->

The reason for building this project is to understand the fundementals of the html structure and ..

<!-- What problem does it solve? -->

One of the problems on the original html file was the repition of unsemantic elements used. For example instead of using div we could clarify what that part of the page is by replaycing div elements to a section/aside/main/figure/nav elements. 

Another issue I've come across was that changes made on html file will effect the stylesheet therefore, making minor changes to css would reflect on the webpage. The only changes that were made on css were on line 27, 36 and 40 which div element was replayced with a nav element. 

One of the criteria was add alt attributes to icon and image elements to have a further description of what that image/icon shows. 

Added comments to the changes on the html file in order to keep a record of the changes that has been made.

<!-- What did you learn? -->

I have learnt the importance of using a semantic html structure in order to clarify the different sections and the layout of the website. 

Also it gave me the ability to use the developer tools on the webpage and hover over the different sections of the code. This enabled me to make changes on the html in order to follow a sequential order.
